# Decentralized Freelance Marketplace

## Project Description
A decentralized platform where clients can post freelance jobs and freelancers can accept and complete them. All payments are securely handled using smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries.

## Project Vision
To empower the global freelance economy by enabling trustless, peer-to-peer job contracts and payment settlements on the blockchain.

## Key Features
- Clients can post jobs with a description and a locked-in budget
- Freelancers can accept open jobs directly from the platform
- Freelancers mark jobs as completed once done
- Clients can release payments only after verifying job completion
- Ensures transparency, fair payouts, and removes middlemen

## Future Scope

- Arbitration mechanism for disputes
- Support for milestone-based payments
